# Problem Statement:

**Analyze a dataset for metro transport to gain insights into various aspects of metro systems around the world. The dataset, stored in a CSV file, contains information on different metro systems including the metro name, city, country, service opening date, last expansion date, number of stations, system length, annual ridership in millions, annual ridership, and the year of record.
**
The objective of the analysis is to explore and understand the metro systems based on the available data. The analysis will involve examining the following aspects:

    1.Ridership Trends: Investigate the annual ridership in millions and identify patterns, trends, and variations across different metro systems. Determine the metro systems with the highest and lowest ridership levels and understand any factors contributing to these differences.

    2.Geographic Distribution: Analyze the distribution of metro systems across different cities and countries. Identify the cities and countries with the highest number of metro systems and explore any geographical patterns or correlations.

    3.Expansion and Development: Study the service opening and expansion dates to evaluate the growth and development of metro systems. Identify the metro systems that have recently opened or expanded, and assess the frequency of expansion across different regions.

    4.System Characteristics: Explore the number of stations and system length for each metro system. Determine the metro systems with the most extensive networks and investigate any relationships between the system length and other factors such as ridership or years of operation.

    5.Record Analysis: Examine the year of record to understand the timeframe covered by the dataset and identify any limitations or biases in the data. Consider the impact of data completeness and reliability on the analysis results.
